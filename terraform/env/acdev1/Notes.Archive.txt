* ACM PCA

  * DISABLED BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO EXPENSIVE

  * ROOT PCA

    * TYPICALLY ONE ROOT PCA PER ACCOUNT
    * CREATED MANUALLY, NOT BY TERRAFORM
    * THE SINGLE ACCOUNT-WIDE ROOT PCA CAN SIGN CERTS FOR TERRAFORM-CREATED SUBORDINATE PCAS
      IN ALL ENVIRONMENTS IN THE ACCOUNT/(REGION?)

    1. Go to ACM console
    2. Create root PCA
    3. Default settings
    4. After it is created, install a certificate
      4.1 validity 20 years (subordinate PCA validity will have to be less than this)
      4.2 confirm and install
      4.3 "Status" should be "Active"

  * SIGN ENVIRONMENT SUBORDINATE PCA (ACM PRIVATE CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY) WITH ROOT CA KEY

    * IF YOUR ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES A SUBORDINATE PCA (LIKE THE REFERENCE ENV), YOU MUST SIGN IT
    WITH THE ROOT PCA KEY BEFORE YOU CAN ISSUE PRIVATE ACM CERTS

    1. Log in to AWS ACM Console, "Private CAs" section
    2. Select the Private CA that was created for your environment
       * it should be "Type: Subordinate" and "Status: Pending Certificate"
    3. Select "Actions / Install CA Certificate"
    4. Select "ACM Private CA / Next"
    5. Under "Parent private CA", select the appropriate root PCA
    6. Change "Validity" to 20 years, leave other options as-is, Next...
    7. Review and press "Generate"
    8. You should see a confirmation message like:
          "Success!  Your CA certificate was installed successfully.  The status of this CA is active
          and able to issue private certificates."
       And the subordinate PCA Status should change to "Active"

  * DESTROY ENVIRONMENT WITH ACM PCA

    * In order to destroy/delete an ACM PCA, you must first "disable" it. This can be done from the console.
