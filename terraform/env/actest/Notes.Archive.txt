    1. Log in to AWS ACM Console, "Private CAs" section
    2. Select the Private CA that was created for your environment
       * it should be "Type: Subordinate" and "Status: Pending Certificate"
    3. Select "Actions / Install CA Certificate"
    4. Select "ACM Private CA / Next"
    5. Under "Parent private CA", select the appropriate root PCA
    6. Change "Validity" to 20 years, leave other options as-is, Next...
    7. Review and press "Generate"
    8. You should see a confirmation message like:
          "Success!  Your CA certificate was installed successfully.  The status of this CA is active
          and able to issue private certificates."
       And the subordinate PCA Status should change to "Active"
