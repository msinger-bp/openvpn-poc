##  MYSQL RDS REPLICA NOTES
##
##  ON CREATION, MYSQL RDS REPLICAS WILL:
##
##    * PRODUCE A SPURIOUS ERROR: "InvalidParameterCombination: Both storage size and iops must be specified when modifying storage size or iops on an DB Instance that has iops"
##      * THIS ERROR DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE REPLICAS WERE NOT CREATED - THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREATED
##      * THE ERROR WILL NOT REAPPEAR ON SUBSEQUENT PLAN OR APPLY ACTIONS
##    * BE CREATED WITH THE (INCORRECT) MASTER INSTANCE SECURITY GROUP
##      * THIS SHOULD BE CORRECTED ON SUBSEQUENT APPLY ACTION
##    * REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU SPECIFY "max_allocated_storage" FOR A MYSQL RDS REPLICA, IT MAY BE "DISABLED"
##      * THIS IS APPARENTLY A TF BUG
##      * YOU CAN ENABLE IT IN THE CONSOLE AND TF WILL NOT TRY TO MODIFY IT DURING A SUBSEQUENT APPLY
##
##  AFTER SEEING THE ABOVE ERROR:
##
##    1. RUN TERRAFORM APPLY AGAIN
##      * THE "storage size and iops must be specified" ERROR WILL NOT REAPPEAR
##      * THE SECURITY GROUP WILL BE CORRECTED AND WILL NOT CHANGE ON SUBSEQUENT APPLIES
##    2. MANUALLY MODIFY THE REPLICA INSTANCES AND ENABLE STORAGE AUTOSCALING
##      * THIS ALSO WILL NOT BE CHANGED ON SUBSEQUENT APPLIES


##  LAUNCH AN RDS INSTANCE FROM AN ENCRYPTED SNAPSHOT IN ANOTHER ACCOUNT:
##
##  1. IN THE SOURCE ACCOUNT, CREATE A NEW "CUSTOMER-MANAGED" KMS KEY AND SHARE IT WITH THE
##     TARGET ACCOUNT
##
##  2. IN THE SOURCE ACCOUNT, CREATE A MANUAL SNAPSHOT USING THE SHARED KMS KEY, OR COPY AN
##     EXISTING SNAPSHOT USING THE SHARED KMS KEY. CALL IT "...-shared" OR SIMILAR.
##
##  3. SHARE THE SNAPSHOT WITH THE TARGET ACCOUNT
##
##  4. IN THE TARGET ACCOUNT, COPY THE SHARED SNAPSHOT USING THE DESIRED KMS KEY. NAME IT
##     "...-copied" OR SIMILAR
##
##  5. IN THE TARGET ACCOUNT, INSTANTIATE YOUR RDS INSTANCE USING THE LOCAL SNAPSHOT
